This Git repo presents the source code of the research paper titled "ATCN: Resource-Efficient Processing of Time Series on Edge". ATCN enables fast time-series prediction and accurate classification in resource-constrained embedded systems. It is a family of compact networks with formalized hyperparameters that enable application-specific adjustments to be made to the model architecture. It is designed primarily for embedded edge devices with limited performance and memory, such as wearable biomedical devices and real-time reliability monitoring systems. 

# Update
The Git repository will be updated with the ATCN source code as soon as the ACM transaction paper is published online.
